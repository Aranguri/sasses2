OK. What do we want to do?
I want to do something that has general intelligence.

It seems as if real math can't be done by pattern matching (as some parts of nlp/image processing can be done.) It seems math needs both an intuitive and a formal system. The intuitive system comes up with solutions and steps while the formal system tells us whether the ideas from the intuitive system are correct. The intuitive system has to be like randomized algorithms or pattern-matching: it should find solutions that work in most cases. Thus, it takes into account the trade-off between being sure that the model works and how good the model works for most of the cases.

For instance, a Goedel Machine rewrites its program iff it proved the rewriting was the best thing to do. Thus it won't be wrong. And that's how math works. I only believe your statement if you prove it. Scientists in math and CS don't just propose a statement and say, "this makes intuitive sense."

However, let's consider science. Science is empirical and we thus believe in a thing iff there is evidence that supports that thing. Most of machine learning is empirical: we believe in the models that had better results.

Instead of achieveing AGI, we just need to get an AGI that researches. We don't need for it to recognize images, text, or have emotions/consciouness. We just need for to propose, create, and verify new AI models.

It seems as if both intuition and formal system are required. Intuition because we need some way to prune the combinatorial explosion of formal systems. And a formal system because it allows us to do math.

The thing is that I don't know what to code now. Reading seems better, but at the same time, I don't have the energies to read. So I'd need something that makes that gives me energies (or that doesn't drain me.) At the same time, I can't know what to do
