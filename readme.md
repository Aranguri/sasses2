# General
## Instructions for running
The interesting things are in the experiments folder. After cloning this repo, you can run cd experiments/talkchain/ and python talkchain.py to get the chain-of-thoughts experiment running. You need python 3.6 and the datasets, that you can download from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RsuDu5i70rIrh-jzoTDaHQWD0Ie4V_A7&export=download. This folder should be located in the root of the project. Have fun :)

# API
The idea is for runner and task to be functions that can be run independently of the actual task and mann we are using.
